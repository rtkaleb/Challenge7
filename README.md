## 📘 Project Context

**BookingMx** is a Mexican platform dedicated to hotel reservations. The company seeks to strengthen its software reliability by incorporating **automated unit testing** for its core modules.  
This initiative ensures that every reservation, cancellation, and visualization of nearby cities operates consistently and without regressions.

The project involves **testing two independent modules**:
1. A **Java reservations module** (server-side) tested with **JUnit**.
2. A **JavaScript visualization module** (client-side) tested with **Jest**.

Through this challenge, we aim to **guarantee code quality, increase coverage (≥ 90%)**, and **enhance maintainability** across the system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement and configure **unit testing** environments for Java and JavaScript.
- Achieve a **minimum of 90% code coverage** in both modules.
- Improve documentation, error handling, and software reliability.
- Apply agile principles (sprints, deliverables, retrospective logs).
- Foster sustainable, maintainable, and cost-effective development practices.

## 5) What to test (Reservations)
Minimum coverage should include:
- **Create reservation**: happy path (valid dates, capacity ok), conflict path (overlap), invalid inputs.
- **Edit reservation**: change dates/guests, conflict detection, validation.
- **Cancel reservation**: normal cancel, cancel non‑existent id, cancel already canceled.
- **Validation**: check-in < check-out, future dates, max capacity, hotel exists, room exists.
- **Edge cases**: same-day booking, time zone boundaries (if applicable), nulls, empty strings.

> If code uses repositories/services, **mock** them with Mockito so tests don’t hit databases or external APIs.

---

## 6) Example tests
See the two example classes in `src/test/java/mx/booking/reservations/`:
- `ReservationServiceTest.java` (service-level behavior with mocks: create/edit/cancel/conflicts)
- `ReservationValidatorTest.java` (pure validation unit tests)

Copy/adapt method names/interfaces to your codebase.

---

## 7) How to run tests & coverage (beginner‑proof)
### IntelliJ (mouse path)
- Right‑click the **`test`** folder → **Run 'All Tests'**.
- To see coverage: **Run with Coverage** (green play icon dropdown → *Run with Coverage*).  
  Or use Maven goal **`verify`** to generate the JaCoCo site report.

### Terminal (PowerShell)
- Run tests:  
  ```powershell
  mvn -q test
  ```
- Generate coverage report & enforce ≥ 90%:  
  ```powershell
  mvn -q verify
  ```
- Open HTML report:  
  `target/site/jacoco/index.html` (double-click in File Explorer).

> If `verify` fails with “Rule violated… minimum is 0.90”, add tests or reduce dead code until it passes 90%.

---

## 8) Documentation — Test Log 

```
# Sprint 1 – Test Log (BookingMx)

Date: YYYY‑MM‑DD
Commit: <short-sha or branch>

Module: Reservations

Issue #1
- Symptom: e.g., "createReservation allowed overlapping dates"
- Root cause: business rule not applied in X method
- Fix: added overlap check in ReservationService.create()
- Test(s): shouldRejectOverlappingDates_whenCreatingReservation()

Issue #2
- Symptom: ...
- Root cause: ...
- Fix: ...
- Test(s): ...

Coverage Summary (from JaCoCo)
- Instructions: 92%
- Branches: 86%
- Lines: 91%
Notes: Branches under 90% because conflict resolution has multiple paths. Will improve in Sprint 2.
```

---

## 9) Common errors (quick fixes)
- **“No tests were found”** → You used JUnit 4 annotations or wrong package names. Use `@Test` from `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`. Ensure `maven-surefire-plugin` is ≥ 3.x and `useJUnitPlatform` is set (Maven) / `useJUnitPlatform()` (Gradle).
- **Mockito NPE** → Annotate with `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)` and use `@Mock` + `@InjectMocks`. Don’t forget to create stubs via `when(...).thenReturn(...)`.
- **Coverage stuck < 90%** → Add tests for negative paths/exceptions. Cover `else` branches. Consider extracting validation into a small class (easier to unit test).
- **Date/Time bugs** → Prefer `LocalDate` over `Date`. Avoid `now()` in production methods; inject a `Clock` for deterministic tests.

---

## 10) Definition of Done (Sprint 1)
- [ ] All unit tests green in IntelliJ and CLI.
- [ ] JaCoCo `verify` passes with **≥ 90% instruction coverage**.
- [ ] Test Log updated.
- [ ] README updated with **How to run tests** and **Coverage** badges/notes.
- [ ] Push branch and open PR for review.

---

## 11) Next (for Sprint 2 & 3 preview)
- Sprint 2: JavaScript module (Jest) for **nearby cities graph** (we’ll set up Node + Jest + jsdom and write tests for data shaping and distance calc).
- Sprint 3: Integrate both reports in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) and tighten docs.

# 🧪 Sprint 2 – Unit Testing with Jest for Graph Visualization  
### Challenge 7 – BookingMx

## 📘 Project Overview

During this sprint, the focus was on **testing and validating the JavaScript module** responsible for generating a **graph of nearby cities** around a customer’s chosen destination within the **BookingMx** platform.  
This feature visually connects destinations based on their geographic proximity, allowing users to explore alternative travel options within a specific radius.

The **main objective** of Sprint 2 was to ensure that the logic for computing distances, filtering nearby cities, and constructing the visual graph was fully tested, **stable under all conditions**, and maintained a **minimum coverage threshold of 90%**.

The sprint included:
1. Environment setup and Jest configuration.  
2. Development of automated test cases for the graph logic and distance calculations.  
3. Validation of error handling and input sanitation.  
4. Generation of a coverage report.  
5. Documentation of key technical challenges and solutions.

---

## 🎯 General Objective

To guarantee the **functional correctness, stability, and maintainability** of the JavaScript graph visualization module through comprehensive **unit testing** using the Jest framework.

---

## 🧩 Technical Context

The graph visualization module connects a *destination city* to several *neighboring cities*, representing each as **nodes** and **edges**:

- **Nodes** → cities (destination + nearby).
- **Edges** → links between the destination and nearby cities, annotated with the physical distance in kilometers.
- The algorithm excludes duplicates, filters cities that exceed the defined distance limit, and orders them by proximity.

This module depends on precise geospatial calculations based on latitude and longitude coordinates, employing the **Haversine formula** to measure great-circle distances on Earth.

---

## ⚙️ Functional Components

### 1️⃣ `src/haversine.js`
Implements the **Haversine formula** to calculate the distance (in kilometers) between two geographical points given their latitude and longitude.  
The module includes:
- **Validation** of coordinate values and ranges (lat ∈ [-90, 90], lng ∈ [-180, 180]).
- **Exceptions** (`TypeError`, `RangeError`) for malformed or missing inputs.
- Output rounding to three decimal places for consistency.

### 2️⃣ `src/graph.js`
Builds and manages the **graph structure** of nearby cities.
Main responsibilities:
- **`assertCity(city)`** → Validates each city object’s structure and data types.  
- **`normalizeInput(destination, cities)`** → Cleans and filters input data, removing duplicates and invalid entries.  
- **`computeNearby(destination, cities, options)`** → Computes distances to all valid cities and selects the nearest ones according to `maxDistanceKm` and `topK` limits.  
- **`buildGraph(destination, cities, options)`** → Integrates all steps, returning a graph object containing `nodes`, `edges`, and `meta` information.

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing Implementation

The testing framework used was **Jest**, which allowed an expressive syntax for defining, running, and reporting test results.  
All tests were designed following the **AAA (Arrange–Act–Assert)** pattern to ensure readability and maintainability.

### 🧮 `__tests__/haversine.test.js`
- Validates distance calculation between known cities (e.g., Mexico City ↔ Monterrey ≈ 705 km).  
- Ensures invalid coordinates produce explicit exceptions.  
- Confirms correct behavior for boundary values and numerical precision.

### 🧠 `__tests__/graph.test.js`
- Confirms that input normalization correctly removes nulls, duplicates, and invalid data.  
- Verifies that the destination is excluded from the list of nearby cities.  
- Tests that computed distances respect the configured maximum radius (`maxDistanceKm`).  
- Checks that nearby cities are sorted in ascending order by distance.  
- Ensures the graph returns the correct number of nodes and edges.  
- Validates that improper configurations (e.g., `topK = 0`) throw descriptive errors.

All tests were crafted to handle **unexpected inputs** and **graceful degradation**, ensuring the module would never break the application when receiving malformed or incomplete data.

---

## 🧰 Configuration Details

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.cjs`)
- Sets test environment to Node.js.
- Collects coverage from all files under `/src/`.
- Enforces global coverage thresholds (90% minimum on all metrics).
- Generates textual and HTML coverage reports.

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 90,
    functions: 90,
    lines: 90,
    statements: 90
  }
}
```

### npm Scripts (`package.json`)
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest --coverage",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "coverage:open": "node -e "require('child_process').exec(process.platform==='win32'?'start coverage\\lcov-report\\index.html':'xdg-open coverage/lcov-report/index.html')""
}
```

---

## 🧾 Execution and Coverage Results

After running `npm test`, all defined cases passed successfully.  
The coverage report demonstrated that the target threshold was exceeded.

| Metric | Coverage |
|---------|-----------|
| Statements | 96% |
| Branches | 93% |
| Functions | 95% |
| Lines | 97% |

Jest automatically generated an HTML report stored in:
```
/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```
This report includes color-coded metrics per file, showing precisely which lines and branches were executed during testing.

---

## 🔍 Quality Validation and Error Scenarios

Each function was evaluated under both **normal** and **edge** conditions:

| Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|----------------|----------------|
| Valid coordinates | Correct distance in km |
| Missing `lat` or `lng` | `TypeError` with descriptive message |
| Latitude > 90 or < –90 | `RangeError` |
| City array empty | Returns graph with one node (destination only) |
| Duplicate IDs | Duplicates removed automatically |
| Invalid `maxDistanceKm` / `topK` | `RangeError` exception |
| Null entries in array | Ignored during normalization |
| Distance limit exceeded | City excluded from results |

This rigorous approach guarantees that any data inconsistency or malformed input is properly managed, preventing runtime failures in the BookingMx web platform.
